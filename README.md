# Description
This mini-project was my first experiment with Machine Learning and Brain.js and trying to use it along with my very unrefined HTML and CSS skills was a challenge. I wanted no outlines or any tutorials or anything so all of this was from scratch besides looking at the fundamentals of Brain.js and a few quick looks in W3School for HTML and CSS problems I had.

### Notes
Here are a few notes I had during the creation of this project:
- HTML is quick to pick up on (This project took 15 minutes to code the entire Tic-Tac-Toe board vs. my first "website" for my sister which took a few days)
- I still don't know the math behind neural networks
- Learning is based on a "good vs bad" sort of system, 0 being bad 1 being good
- JavaScript is basically java (Wow!)
- I'm better at algorithms than design, but I still like designing
- The AI I made repeats a bunch of moves...
